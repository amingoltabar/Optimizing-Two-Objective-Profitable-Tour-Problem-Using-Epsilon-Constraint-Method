# Optimizing-Two-Objective-Profitable-Tour-Problem-Using-Epsilon-Constraint-Method
The Profitable Tour problem (PTP) is defined as follows. Consider a set of nodes n = 1,..,N where each node 
is associated with the non-negative profit Pi. The start and end nodes are fixed to nodes 1 and |N| respectively.
The non-negative travel cost between nodes i and j is represented as tij. The goal of the PTP is to determine a route, 
starting at node 1 and ending at node N that visits the subset of N and maximizes the total collected profit minus
the total travel cost.
Code is provided through .mod files and you can run the code with your desirable input data.I provided my own input
data in attached excel file.
